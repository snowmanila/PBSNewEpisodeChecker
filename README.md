# PBSNewEpisodeChecker
A script that finds and prints all new/upcoming episodes on PBS Kids' schedule. The script will read all dates between the current date and a year after, gathering all schedule details for each day from PBS WHRO's site, and checks if an episode/special is new or not. If new, the episode/special is cross-referenced with PBS WGTE (as to not print already aired episodes/specials as 'new'), cutting down the list and all new episodes are printed with its corresponding date.
